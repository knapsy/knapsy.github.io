Today I had a pleasure of presenting at one of the first [SecTalks Melbourne](http://www.sectalks.org/melbourne/) sessions - if you're from Melbourne, Australia area and into IT security / geeky stuff, make sure to sign up!

The talked covered basic methodology as well as some tips and tricks on breaking out of restricted Unix shells (such as ```rbash``` and ```rksh```) that I came across during several CTFs and also at the "real life" engagements.

The slides from my talk are available at [SpeakerDeck here](https://speakerdeck.com/knaps/escape-from-shellcatraz-breaking-out-of-restricted-unix-shells).

Enjoy! :)
